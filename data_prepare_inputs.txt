# Specify number of receivers in experiment. Same number as in data_intake_sbe_2d.m. This may exceed number channels in audiofile from Raven Pro.
5
# Channel number mapping old to new
# old: channel number in raven pro. Equals column 3 in the raven pro data selection table. Column 3 heading label is 'Channel'
# new: it is the sound file receiver number inputed to sbe as defined by data_intake_sbe_2d.m
{5: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 1: 5}
# Channel number mapping new to old
{1: 5, 2: 2, 3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 1}
# Specify the old channel number which will become sound file receiver number 1 for sbe. This is sbe's reference receiver.
# There has to be at least one sound selected on the reference receiver.
5
# Specify the maximum distance (m) that th(e animal can be detected from any receiver.
100000
# Specify minimum vertical z coordinate of calling animal (m) -> z is positive up and zero at the ocean surface
-100
# Specify maximum vertical z coordinate of calling animal (m)
0
# Specify minimum 3D speed of animal (m/s) -> it must always be 0
0
# Specify maximum 3D speed of animal (m/s)
13
# Specify minimum three-dimensional effective speed of sound (m/s) between animal and any receiver. Row has two values, separated by space.
# Value must be correct with confidence of 100%.  If value unknown to you, set to -1. If unknown, Scientific Innovations will provide them.
# "Effective speed" is the straight-line distance between animal and a receiver divided by how long it takes sound to go between them.
1430
# Same as above, except is maximum three-dimensional effective speed.
1500
# Specify same_object parameter as defined by data_intake_sbe_2d.m. Recommend setting to 0 unless you speak with John Spiesberger first.
0
# Maximum duration (s) of emitted call. If unknown, enter an upper bound, and it must be greater than zero.
# This does not count propagation effects of sound through water or air. This is simply the maximum duration of the emitted sound.
