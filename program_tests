data_prepare.py               -Provided two hour-long multichannel audiofiles to RavenPro.
			       RavenPro outputted its selection table with selections
			       from both audiofiles.  Then inputted the selection table,
			       the two multichannel audio files to data_prepare.py, which
			       outputted sound_N.wav and info_N files.  The sound_N.wav
			       files were imported back into RavenPro and those signals
			       looked like those displayed with RavenPro from  the two
			       hour-long multichannel audiofiles. This means data_prepare.py
			       appears to be able to retrieve correct data from two
			       hour-long multichannel audiofiles. This worked using
			       software from changeset 4. This test result is documented
			       in changeset 5.                                                 jspies       11Mar2025 17:17
                              -changeset 6: worked with new data in Raven selection table.
			      Yash Samat ran data_prepare.py with new table, sent sound
			      files to Kristin Hodge, and she verified spectrograms from
			      sound_N.wav files look like sounds she boxed with Raven Pro.     jspies       12Mar2025 15:03
